Analyze A/B Test Results

This project is for Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity.

In the project, I will be following along the questions provided to work through the notebook to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
